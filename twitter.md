1/ "A Truly Inclusive News App"

What if there was a place where all #SriLanka could read news?

A place without the segregations of language
and the resulting echo chambers?

https://nuuuwan.github.io/news_lk_app
is a #BabyStep in this direction.

Read on for details.

...

2/ According to the 2012 census,
21% of Adult Sri Lankans can't read සිංහල.
70% English
74% தமிழ்.

If you can't read  தமிழ்,
you can't read news published in தமிழ்.
Ditto English &  සිංහල.

Hence, "segregation" & "echo-chambers".

...

3/ #NewsLKApp presents news from multiple source,
along with සිංහල, தமிழ் and English translations.

For example, this is what news published in தமிழ் looks like in සිංහල, and vice versa.

5/ The above is very much an initial list.
Let me know what other sources  you'd like me to add to #NewsLKApp.

Now go forth and read some news!
(Hopefully some published in a language
you don't usually read)
